# Mobile Store
For this project, we scraped mobile data from the GSM website. We created tables for a MySQL database and imported the data into it using sqlalchamy. The structure of the database is represented in the DataBase folder. After that, we performed some statistical analysis using Python. Finally, we presented the output in a PowerBI dashboard.
